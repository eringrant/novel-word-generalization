NOTES:

O: Some first meanings are clearly not right, but I left them as OK
since the WN hierarchy was not very different between it and one of
the good meanings.

W: If an item is marked W, the first appropriate sense for CDS will be
marked with 1 (or there's a comment about it).

P: These should be correctable automatically using a word list,
perhaps with some noise.

N: Four of five of these are pronouns; I don't know why "heck" doesn't
have any synsets.  Correctable automatically with some noise.

L: Correctable automatically.

F: So far, most of the ones with plant and food meaning should be
the food, and all of the ones with plant and food could be food.  (Ie,
there are no items with both a plant and a food meaning for which the
food meaning is wrong.)  So these could be corrected automatically,
perhaps with some noise.

E: Just what it says.  Not correctable automatically.
