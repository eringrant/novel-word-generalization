novel_word_generalization
=============

This code implements the model described in 
Nematzadeh, A., Grant, E., Stevenson, S. (2015). 
A Computational Cognitive Model of Novel Word Generalization. 
*Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing.*

(The above work is an extension of 
Fazly, A., Alishahi, A., & Stevenson, S. (2010). 
A Probabilistic Computational Model of Cross-Situational Word Learning. 
*Cognitive Science*, 34(6), 1017-1063.
The original model of Fazly et al. is implemented
